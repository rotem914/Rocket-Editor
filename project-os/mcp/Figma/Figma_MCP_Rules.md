# Figma MCP — Working Rules

Read this before any Figma MCP work: pushing designs into Figma, reading designs
out, or any `use_figma` / `get_design_context` / asset call.

Every rule here was paid for with a real failed call. The traps are silent by
nature: a green tool result with the wrong file state, so the rules matter more
than they look.

## 0. Setup facts

**Not wired for this project yet.** Fill this table before the first Figma call:
ask Rotem for the file link and the plan, and everything else follows from it.
Until then, the rules below still apply the moment a call is made.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Figma file | not set |
| Target page for generated work | not set |
| Plan and daily MCP call budget | not set — get the plan's number before the first call |

Push generated pages onto the one target page; never scatter them across the
file.

## 0b. Connecting it (the part that is not in this repo)

**The connection is a setting on the machine, never a file here.** An MCP
server is registered in Claude's own configuration, so this repo can carry
every rule in this file and still have no Figma at all. If the tools are
missing, that is the reason, and the fix is a one-time setup by Rotem.

**Never go looking for the connection in another project's folder.** Another
repo's working setup is not this project's, its file keys and its plan are not
this project's either, and reading across projects is a leak waiting to
happen. Ask Rotem instead (CLAUDE.md rule 21).

What Rotem does once, on his machine:

- Register Figma's MCP server with Claude, at user scope so it follows him
  between projects, or at project scope if only this repo should have it.
- Choose the path: Figma's desktop app exposes a local server for the file
  that is open in it, and Figma also hosts a remote server that signs in
  through the browser. Take the current address and command straight from
  Figma's own documentation rather than from another repo, since both have
  changed.
- Confirm the seat: some capabilities need a paid Figma plan, and Dev Mode
  features need a seat that has Dev Mode.

How Claude verifies it, before trusting anything else:

- Search the tool list for the Figma tools first. A deferred tool that has not
  been loaded is invisible, so "I see no Figma tools" is not evidence of a
  missing connection until the search comes back empty.
- Then make ONE identity call (`whoami` where the server exposes it, and it is
  usually free). It answers connected-or-not without spending the budget below.
- If it fails, say so plainly, name what Rotem has to do, and stop. Do not
  improvise a workaround, and do not fall back to another project's files.

Nothing in this section belongs in the repo: no key, no token, no local path
to a credential.

## 1. The call budget is rule #1

- Writes count against the budget, and so do reads (`get_metadata`,
  `get_screenshot`, `get_design_context`, `get_variable_defs`).
  Know the plan's number before the first call.
- The working shape: capture with FREE tools (browser, file reads, grep),
  build in ONE `use_figma` call, verify by the owner's eye in Figma.
  Do not spend a metered screenshot on verification unless the owner OKs it.
- Iterate by fixing, not re-reading. A page done right is 1 to 2 calls.

## 2. Capture: from the real thing, never from memory

- Read the live app's DOM, the real asset, the real file with free tools before
  building. Never guess geometry, colors, or text.
- Colors stored as `lab()` / `oklab()` must be resolved to sRGB first
  (a `<canvas>` does it). Figma cannot use lab strings.
- Capture what does not show in markup explicitly: input and textarea values,
  checkbox states, placeholder text in its real muted color.
- Never mutate project data to stage a capture (ticking a checkbox can
  autosave). Capture as-is, or toggle and restore.

## 3. Build (`use_figma`)

- **The `code` argument is hard-capped at 50 000 characters, with no way
  around it.** Plugin-data stashing across calls is unsupported and Figma
  cannot fetch `localhost`, so the content must fit in one call or be split by
  design.
- Absolute positioning (`layoutMode = 'NONE'`) is pixel-faithful and reliable
  to build blind.
- **Never hard-code a new frame's `x`.** Compute it from the page's CURRENT
  children (max right edge plus a margin), or the new frame lands on top of an
  existing one and the owner sees nothing.
- Text: single lines get auto-width (`textAutoResize = 'WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT'`) so
  a substitute font cannot wrap them; multi-line gets fixed width plus
  `textAutoResize = 'HEIGHT'`.
- **Name every layer semantically at build time.** A hand-written builder that
  skips `.name` ships a file full of "Frame", useless for any round-trip.
- **Mirror the capture's parent-to-child nesting at every level.** Hand-emitted
  flat sequences of positioned nodes recur as flattening bugs (a field's text
  beside the field instead of inside it). Recurse the captured tree and
  substitute only per-instance values.
- For repetitive layouts, write a small builder from fixed geometry plus tiny
  per-item data instead of replaying raw capture; inlining big repetitive JSON
  by hand drops rows and unbalances braces.
- **Verify the builder offline before the metered call, and verify STRUCTURE,
  not only positions.** A position-only check passes flattened output; assert
  each leaf's parent chain against the capture too.
- Pre-flight every `code` string locally: compile it as an async function body
  and count brace balance. A dropped brace is caught free.
- Sanitize captured text: encoding mojibake (an em dash arriving as `â€”`)
  renders verbatim in Figma.
- `use_figma` returns no value. To read data back,
  `throw new Error(JSON.stringify(...))`, but ONLY from a call that made no
  mutations; otherwise split into a check call and an act call.

## 4. Fonts

- **Account-uploaded fonts are loadable by the MCP on any plan** (Figma:
  Settings, Account, Your uploaded fonts). The server sees only the Google
  Fonts catalogue plus those uploads, never locally-installed fonts.
- Resolve exact names via `listAvailableFontsAsync`, never guess style
  spellings. A build script should THROW when a required upload is not visible
  yet (propagation can lag minutes), never silently substitute.
- Do not upload OS system fonts whose license forbids it (Segoe UI); keep a
  lookalike substitute for those.
- Record every substitution. On the way back to code, map values to the
  project's tokens, never literal hex or the substitute font's name.

## 5. Round-trip (Figma to code): the diff must be structural

- A value-only diff is BLIND to deleted, added, or moved layers; it flags a
  value that changed, never a layer that vanished. Compare the layer TREE
  against a saved baseline: presence, count, order, position.
- Code is the source of truth. State the change list first (added, removed,
  changed, and which code target each maps to), then edit and verify per the
  project's own QA.

## 6. SVG artwork as editable vectors

- `figma.createNodeFromSvg(svgString)` is the whole mechanism. It returns a
  frame: name it, `appendChild` it, THEN set `x` / `y`.
- Shrink to fit the 50 000-char cap without touching design code:
  strip SVG filters (Figma renders none of them), round coordinates to whole
  pixels, decimate sampled polylines only (paths with no curves).
  Verify the shrink offline: identical element counts, endpoints preserved.
- `return svg.length` from the build call and compare it with the file on
  disk: a free transfer-integrity check inside the same metered call.
- Group opacity travels: a `<g opacity="0.14">` arrives as a Figma group at
  14%, one slider for the owner instead of a baked-in wash.

## 7. Pages and images: the silent traps

- **`figma.currentPage` resets to the FIRST page on every call.** Resolve the
  page and `await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(pg)` before any id lookup, or every
  id on another page resolves `null`. An unloaded page also reports 0 children;
  never read that as "the page is empty".
- **`figma.getImageByHash()` is not a validity test.** It returns `null` for an
  image that IS in the file but unreferenced by a loaded node; gating a fill on
  it silently drops the picture. Set the `imageHash` unconditionally; it
  resolves at render time.
- **`upload_assets` with a nested `nodeId` is destructive.** Aimed inside a
  built page it can dissolve container frames and delete subtrees while
  returning success. Call it with NO `nodeId`: it drops one throwaway node at
  top level and returns `imageHash` plus `placedOnNodeId`; set the hash as a
  fill in one `use_figma` and remove the throwaway (guard: parent is a PAGE,
  id equals `placedOnNodeId`).
- Prefer PNG uploads. A WebP can upload with `success: true` and then render
  nothing as a fill.
- **Verify by re-reading the tree, not the return value.** A mangled build can
  return a healthy-looking object; after any image step, re-read the root's
  children names and compare against what the builder created.

*Keep this current: when a new gotcha or fix is learned here, add the rule in
place, the same bitten-twice pattern as the rest of the kit. A different MCP
server earns its own folder under `project-os/mcp/` the first time it bites.*
