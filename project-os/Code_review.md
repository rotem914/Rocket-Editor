# Code review

This file is the calibration for reviewing code in Rocket Editor: how severe a
defect is *here*, which mistakes this project keeps making, and how findings get
handed back. Load it before a review starts, not after it ends.

The review itself reads the change and asks whether the code is correct, and that
part is the same everywhere. The bar is not. A generic checklist finds generic
bugs; the bugs that actually ship are the ones this project has shipped before,
and this file is the only place that remembers them.

## When a review runs

Every medium- or high-risk change gets one; `project-os/Workflow.md` carries the
risk scale and the trigger. Rotem can also ask for a wider pass at any
time.

## Scope — pin it, never guess

Say which range you reviewed, before you review it. It has two parts, and each one
is easy to lose:

- work that is already committed but not yet shipped;
- work still sitting uncommitted in the project folder.

Anything that defaults to "uncommitted changes only" will report a clean tree when
the real change was committed an hour ago. That is a silent empty review. Name the
range in the report so an empty result can be trusted.

## A check that never ran is not a check that passed

The other way a review comes back falsely clean. When a pass is split across
several checks, some of them fail to run — they time out, they hit a limit, they
die halfway. A finding whose checks all failed comes back with zero confirmations,
and zero confirmations is not the same as refuted. It means nobody looked.

So read the failure list before the results list. Score a no-vote as
**unverified** and check it by hand. Say in the report that the pass ran degraded,
and give the numbers.

Why this one matters more than it sounds: the serious findings are the expensive
ones to check, so they are exactly the ones that time out. A review that reports
four findings while twenty-four went unexamined is worse than no review, because
it sells confidence nobody earned.

## Severity bar

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **blocking** | Data loss, silent corruption, a security hole, or a break in a stated must-not-break invariant. Fix before it lands. |
| 🟠 **important** | A real defect, or a maintainability break that bites later. No immediate data loss. Should fix; say so if you disagree. |
| 🟡 **nit** | Polish, a small accessibility gap on a non-critical control, cosmetic. Non-blocking. |

Rewrite those three rows with defects this project has actually shipped, in place
of the generic ones. A bar argued from real incidents survives a disagreement
about a rating. A copied one does not.

### The worst bug class here

Name, in one sentence, the worst thing this project's code can do. Write it below.
Then treat that class as **always blocking**, even when the screen looks fine —
that is what calibrates the bar for everything else.

> **Fill this in.** *Example to replace: "The worst thing this app's code can do
> is silently lose or corrupt work a user already saved."*

## Universal review dimensions

The spine of the always-check list. Add or drop dimensions to fit what this
project actually is. For each one, the question to ask:

- **Data & persistence integrity** — can this change silently lose, corrupt, or
  half-write stored data? Are writes atomic, and are reads validated and loud on
  failure?
- **State & concurrency** — stale or lost updates, races, effects that loop,
  out-of-order writes.
- **Contract & schema** — is a schema change backward-compatible? Full versus
  partial writes, version gates, validation of incoming data.
- **Reference & identity** — dangling references after a rename or delete, stable
  ids versus editable ones, list keys.
- **Input & values** — trimming, format, uniqueness, empty versus whitespace,
  numeric edges, untrusted paths, escaping in generated output.
- **Architecture & extension points** — is the single source of truth honored, or
  did a second branch of the same logic appear somewhere else?
- **UI invariants** — tokens over hard-coded values, language and direction,
  theme, focus states, this project's own visual rules.
- **Accessibility** — labels, roles that match real behavior, keyboard paths.
- **Security & untrusted input** — injection, path traversal, secrets in the repo,
  authorization.
- **Performance hot paths** — repeated queries in a loop, work on the keystroke or
  render path, unbounded growth.
- **Process & environment** — build and environment hazards, docs that drift out of
  sync with the code.

## Always-check list — this project's own

**Empty on purpose.** This is the section that makes a review worth running, and
it has to come from Rocket Editor, not from a catalogue. Seed it with the
bootstrap recipe below, then let the calibration loop grow it.

One row per finding-class: a short title, a severity, something concrete enough to
search for, and a pointer to where the reasoning lives. Never restate the record —
point at it, because two copies of the same finding drift apart and then neither
one is worth trusting. Group the rows under the dimensions above.

### State & concurrency

- 🟠 **The confirmation never outlives the key.** Any async step that ends in the
  bubble (an animation's `onfinish`, the clipboard promise, a timer) must re-check
  `inspecting` and `target` when it runs, not when it started. Search for
  `swapContent(` and `.then(` in `content.js`. (Source: `project-os/BugAtlas.md`
  row 1; bitten twice on 2026-09-03.)

### Input & values

- 🟠 **A card value from a React fiber comes from a dev build only.** Production
  fibers carry minified names that exist in no file; the card's rule is that
  unknown is never guessed. Search for `__reactFiber$` and check the `_debugOwner`
  gate is still there. (Source: `notes/Code-Review-2026-09-03-B.md` T2.)

## Bootstrap recipe — fill the list from this project's own memory

Run this once to seed the list, then re-run it whenever the code has moved enough
that the rows feel stale. Sweep these five sources and dedupe what they give you
into rows:

1. **Past review documents** — the finding-classes that keep coming back.
2. **`project-os/History.md`** — bugs that recurred, or took several attempts to
   fix. The highest-value source by far; these are almost always blocking.
3. **`project-os/Decisions.md`** — choices that imply a review rule. "All writes
   are atomic", "schema changes are additive only", "one module owns this map".
4. **The code** — the real save path, the validation boundary, the single-source-of-
   truth modules, and the sharp edges of whatever this project is built on. Cite
   `file:line`.
5. **`CLAUDE.md`** — the invariants that are stated as must-not-break.

## Output — findings as small, executable tasks

A review's deliverable is a list someone can run top to bottom, not a wall of prose.
Two layers:

1. **The reply** — terse: counts by severity, the range reviewed, the headline
   findings. `project-os/Conversations.md` has the reply rules.
2. **The task document** — one file per review, one section per severity (🔴
   first), one block per finding:

```
T# · <short title>          (+ severity marker)
Where:   file:line
Problem: one line — the defect, not a lecture
Fix:     the concrete change (or two options, if there is a real choice)
Verify:  the one check that proves it fixed — a test, a search, the project checks, or a manual step
Status:  [ ] open · [x] done
```

Keep each task small enough to execute on its own; split anything bigger into
numbered sub-tasks. Write it for a reader with no context — Rotem, or a
fresh assistant tomorrow — who should not have to re-read the change to act on it.

## Exceptions — settled, never raise again

**Empty on purpose.** When Rotem rejects a finding, one line lands here,
and no later review raises it again. Without this section every pass re-litigates
the same argument, and the owner pays for it every time.

One row each: what not to flag · the reason in the owner's own words · where it
was raised.

## Calibration loop

After every review, take the verdict and fold it back into this file. The verdict
vocabulary is **fix / drop / backlog**.

- A **rejected** finding becomes an exception row above, or the check gets dropped.
- A **new rule** ("always check X") becomes a row under the right dimension.
- A **severity change** is edited into the row inline.
- A **recurring bug** gets its full record in `project-os/History.md`; this file
  keeps a one-line pointer.
- A **pre-existing** problem the change only sits next to gets flagged and marked
  pre-existing — never fixed silently, never blocking the change. A `backlog`
  verdict sends it to `project-os/Backlog.md`.

Keep this an index of checks, not a bug encyclopedia. The moment a row needs three
paragraphs, the record belongs somewhere else and the row belongs here as a
pointer.
